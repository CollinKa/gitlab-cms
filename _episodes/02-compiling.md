- "How do I add other CMSSW packages?"
objectives:
- "Successfully compile CMSSW example analysis code in GitLab CI"
keypoints:
- "For code to be compiled in CMSSW, it needs to reside within the work area's `src` directory."
- "The code needs to be copied manually using the CI script."
- "When using commands such as `git cms-addpkg`, the git configuration needs to be adjusted/set first."

Now that you know how to get a CMSSW environment, it is time to do something useful with it.

## Compiling code within the repository

For your analysis to be compiled with CMSSW, it needs to reside in the
workarea's `src` directory, and in there follow the directory structure of
two subdirectories (e.g. `AnalysisCode/MyAnalysis`) within which there can be
`src`, `interface`, `plugin` and further directories. Your analysis code
(under version control in GitLab/GitHub) will usually not contain the
CMSSW workarea. The git repository will either
contain the analysis code at the lowest level or could be collected in a
subdirectory to disentangle it from your configuration files such as the
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

We will use an example analysis, which selects pairs of electrons and muons.
[Download the zip file containing the analysis](../files/ZPeakAnalysis.zip)
and extract it now. The analysis code is
in a directory called `ZPeakAnalysis` within which `plugins` (the C++ code)
and `test` (the python config) directories reside.
Add this directory to your repository:

~~~
# unzip ZPeakAnalysis.zip
# mv ZPeakAnalysis ~/awesome-workshop/awesome-gitlab-cms/
git add ZPeakAnalysis
git commit -m "Add ZPeakAnalysis"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

When trying to compile the code in GitLab, the `ZPeakAnalysis` needs
to be copied into the CMSSW workarea, and it's advisable to use environment
variables for this purpose. This would be achieved like this:

~~~
mkdir ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/AnalysisCode
cp -r "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/ZPeakAnalysis" "${CMSSW_BASE}/src/AnalysisCode/"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

With these two commands we will now be able to extend the `.gitlab-ci.yml`
file such that we can compile our analysis code in GitLab. To improve the
readability of the file, the `CMSSW_RELEASE` is defined as a variable:

~~~
cmssw_compile:
  tags:
    - cvmfs
  variables:
    CMS_PATH: /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
    CMSSW_RELEASE: CMSSW_10_6_8_patch1
  script:
    - shopt -s expand_aliases
    - set +u && source ${CMS_PATH}/cmsset_default.sh; set -u
    - cmsrel ${CMSSW_RELEASE}
    - cd ${CMSSW_RELEASE}/src
    - cmsenv
    - mkdir -p AnalysisCode
    - cp -r "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/ZPeakAnalysis" "${CMSSW_BASE}/src/AnalysisCode/"
    - scram b
~~~
{: language-yaml}

> ## Exercise: Test that compilation works
>
> Copy the files from [https://gitlab.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/payload-gitlab-cms/tree/master/ZPeakAnalysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/payload-gitlab-cms/tree/master/ZPeakAnalysis)

> succeeds.

## Adding CMSSW packages

> ## Always add CMSSW packages before compiling analysis code!
>
> Adding CMSSW packages has to happen *before* compiling analysis code in the
> repository, since `git cms-addpkg` will call `git cms-init` for the
> `$CMSSW_BASE/src` directory, and `git init` doesn't work if the directory
> already contains files.
{: .callout}

Assuming that you would like to check out CMSSW packages using the commands
described in the [CMSSW FAQ][cmssw-faq], a couple of additional settings need
to be applied. For instance, try running the following command in GitLab CI
after having set up CMSSW:

~~~
git cms-addpkg PhysicsTools/PatExamples
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will fail:

~~~
Cannot find your details in the git configuration.
Please set up your full name via:
    git config --global user.name '<your name> <your last name>'
Please set up your email via:
    git config --global user.email '<your e-mail>'
Please set up your GitHub user name via:
    git config --global user.github <your github username>
~~~
{: .output}

There are a couple of options to make things work:

- set the config as described above,
- alternatively, create a `.gitconfig` in your repository and use it as described [here][custom-gitconfig],
- run `git cms-init --upstream-only` before `git cms-addpkg` to disable setting up a user remote.

For simplicity, and since we do not need to commit anything back to CMSSW from
GitLab, we will use the latter approach.
A complete `yaml` fragment that checks out a CMSSW package after having set up
CMSSW and then compiles the code looks as follows:

~~~
cmssw_addpkg:
  stage: compile
  tags:
    - cvmfs
  variables:
    CMS_PATH: /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
    CMSSW_RELEASE: CMSSW_10_6_8_patch1
  script:
    - shopt -s expand_aliases
    - set +u && source ${CMS_PATH}/cmsset_default.sh; set -u
    - cmsrel ${CMSSW_RELEASE}
    - cd ${CMSSW_RELEASE}/src
    - cmsenv
    # If within CERN, we can speed up interaction with CMSSW:
    - export CMSSW_MIRROR=https://:@git.cern.ch/kerberos/CMSSW.git
    # This is another trick to speed things up independent of your location:
    - export CMSSW_GIT_REFERENCE=/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmssw.git.daily
    # Important: run git cms-init with --upstream-only flag to not run into
    # problems with git config
    - git cms-init --upstream-only
    - git cms-addpkg PhysicsTools/PatExamples
    - scram b
~~~
{: language-yaml}

The additional two variables that are exported here, `CMSSW_MIRROR` and
`CMSSW_GIT_REFERENCE` can speed up interaction with git, in particular
faster package checkouts. Mind that `CMSSW_MIRROR` is specific to when
developing within the CERN network. Settings these variables is *not*
mandatory.
